This is the password manager program created by Devoto, this is a intermediate practice for my technical evaluation.

# The program has the actions for:
    1. Add a password
    2. Change the password
    3. Delete the password

# Password Managing 

## This program consist in a database to storage a list of password that a specified user inserts, with the capacity to add, change & delete all of those passwords. 

## The passwords are managed in a SHA-256 cryptography system.  

# Composition of the files.
